# Numbers-Game
# Lab1

This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates basic calculations on an array of numbers.

## Introduction

The program performs the following steps:

1. Asks the user to input four numbers and populates an array with those numbers.
2. Calculates the sum of the numbers in the array and displays the result.
3. Asks the user to pick a random number from the array and multiplies it by the sum.
4. Displays the product of the random number and the sum.
5. Asks the user to input a number to divide the product by.
6. Calculates the quotient of the product divided by the user-provided number and displays the result.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to input four numbers.
3. Select a random number from the provided options.
4. Enter a number to divide the product by.
5. The program will display the calculated sum, product, and quotient.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the sum of the numbers is less than 20, an error message is displayed.
- If an invalid index is chosen when selecting a random number from the array, an error message is displayed.
- If the user enters zero as the divisor, an error message is displayed.
